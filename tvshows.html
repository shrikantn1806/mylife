              How I Met Your Mother was a really funny TV Show for me. Although the ending could have been better, I really enjoyed watching the story of Ted Mosby telling his kids how he met their mother through flashbacks. <br>
                
            <h2>The Flash</h2>

            <p>
               The Flash is another DC superhero, and personally, the storyline and plot of this series is much better than other DC TV shows such as Arrow and DC's Legends of Tomorrow.
